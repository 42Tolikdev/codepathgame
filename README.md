## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   Even though I had solid background of HTML, CSS and JS, I used some websites that helped me a lot, one of them being w3schools.

https://www.w3schools.com/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   The challenge was to do the logic of the game after I added a new button at the end. It took me sleepless night to find the bug, which was hindering the last button to work when the game started.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   After doing this small project, I came to realize how painful it is to develop multi-functional websites, which operate in different spheres like online banking, online shopping and many more. I have been even more interested in developing the websites since this little project made me learn a lot. Plus, I would be more into debugging the code, testing it with different scenarios.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   There are a bunch of customizations to be done on this project yet. One of them I would add is the background image for the buttons once they are clicked. Other functionality can be the timer. I would also add the button at which a user chooses the difficulty level, from 4 to 10 patterns maybe.
